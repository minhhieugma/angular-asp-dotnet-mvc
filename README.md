# Angular SPA with ASP.NET MVC Template
A simple Angular SAP + ASP.NET MVC at backend
- .NET 6
- Angular 12
  
# Design Patterns
- DI
- Repository
- Singleton
- Mediator
- CQRS
- etc

# Persistence
- JSON files

# Unit Tests
- Frontend
- Backend

# Thoughts
- I would have not used Repository to deal with the persistene - JSON file. 
- I would like to use Entity Framework to work with JSON files and any other types of storage. Fundamentally, EF applies both Repository and UoW patterns already. 
  - We can implement it by ourself 
  - Or check it out [https://github.com/morrisjdev/FileContextCore](https://github.com/morrisjdev/FileContextCore)
- Both backend and frontend source code structures are not completed yet and needed to futher works. So, let me know your suggestions or improvements.
